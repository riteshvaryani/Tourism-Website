<h2>Boston Skyline</h2>

<b>The beauty of Boston</b> lies in its accessibility.
</br>
</br>
 Boston’s skyline is less cluttered with 
architectural skyscrapers than other American cities and its population stands less than one million
. It is a city known for specific neighborhood culture and a sense of strong community. Whether it’s
 the colonial architecture and intricate antique shops of Beacon Hill or the dense population and 
 fine Asian eateries of Chinatown, there is a neighborhood for everyone. Boston is a “walking city,”
 in that the average tourist can gain inferences in history, architecture, and art from a careless 
 stroll down Charles Street.
</br>
</br>
The lush history of Boston spans hundreds of years. It is the home to the first U.S. mail route, 
the first newspaper publication, the first draft of the U.S. constitution, and even America’s oldest
 pub. However, above the foundation of historical significance is the innovation of our modern era.
 A focal point for commerce, higher education, medical care, and creativity, Boston is one of 
 today’s greatest centers of excellence. Crafted by the hands of America’s founding fathers, Boston
 will continue to be challenged as the most intellectual and well-instructed hands of today’s 
 generation
