Boston Harbor Cruises offer day trips including whale watching and sightseeing but the nights heat up with Salsa 
dance cruises all summer. Take lessons and sip tropical cocktails before the boat leaves. Then as you take off, 
enjoy the cruise and show off your moves on the dance floor as the DJ plays music on two decks. Latin cuisine is 
served onboard and there is an after party at a local lounge included in the ticket. If salsa is not your style, 
Boston Harbor Cruises also does a Mystery Cruise or Boston Ghost Cruise as well.

Details:

High-speed catamarans boast three outdoor viewing decks, climate-controlled cabin space, state-of-the-art audio-visual, and a galley that offers snacks and beverages for purchase.
If you don't see a whale on your trip, you'll receive a free ticket for a future Boston Harbor Cruises whale watch.
Whales are most active from April through the end of October.
