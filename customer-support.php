Our Commitment to You<br/><br/>
A safe ride every time<br/><br/>
We're continuously monitoring the system to help keep you safe. In addition to Transit Police patrolling the 
system all day, cameras have been installed in stations and on our vehicles, and  employees are keeping their
eyes and ears open for suspicious activity. You can help too. If you see something, say something by calling the
Transit Police at 617-222-1212. <br/><br/>

Courteous, clean, accessible, and dependable service<br/>
All  employees are trained to ask the question, “How can we help you today?” Simply put, we're here to help you
reach your destination in a timely and positive way. If you find our service less than adequate, see a concern,
or have an idea for how to improve the system please let us know how we can do better by visiting the customer
support section of mbta.com.<br/><br/>

Accurate and timely information<br/>
We make it our priority to provide you with timely information on service conditions and delays. If we anticipate
delays of more than 15 minutes on any service we will post that information to mbta.com, send alerts to T-Alerts
subscribers, and post information to station message boards. Want to know where your bus or train is? More than
two dozen apps are available to track your bus, subway, or commuter rail train at mbta.com/apps.<br/><br/>

Improved communications<br/>
Your comments, questions, and ideas help make the T better. The General Manager and T's senior management team are
always out on the system. Join them at regular “Join the GM” sessions and customer roundtables. Can't meet us in
person? Send us a note through the customer support section of mbta.com, on Twitter at twitter.com/mbtagm, or 
through mobile tools. We make it our priority to respond within 5 days.<br/><br/>

Transparent performance measures<br/>

our performance are available in our monthly ScoreCard at mbta.com/about_the_mbta/scorecard.<br/><br/>
