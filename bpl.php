<p>Built in 1848, the Boston Public Library was the first free publicly supported municipal library 
in America, the first public library to lend a book and the first with a children's room. On the 
National Register of Historic Places, the library opened in 1852 as the first free, publicly-support
ed municipal library in America, setting a precedent for grand scale urban libraries. 
</br>
</br>
The fine building is reminiscent of an Italian Renaissance palace surrounding an open courtyard. With more 
than 650,000 photographs, 100,000 prints (some by Rembrandt and Toulouse-Lautrec) and 250 different 
papers in the 'Newspaper Room', the library now has Internet access, two restaurants and an on-line
 store with reproductions of its priceless artwork. All exhibits are free, open to the public and 
 books are only the beginning.
