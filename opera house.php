The Boston Opera House first opened in 1928 as the B. F. Keith Memorial Theatre. It was commissioned by Keith’s 
collaborator Edward Albee as a tribute to his late business partner and friend Benjamin Franklin Keith, the 
originator and leading impresario of refined vaudeville entertainment that flourished in North America from the 
late 1800s until the 1930s. Thomas White Lamb, the most accomplished theater architect of his day, was hired to 
bring all of his experience and skills to bear with a mandate to “spare no expense” in tribute to Keith. Since a 
full $50 million restoration was completed in 2004, the results of Lamb’s genius and the work of the world’s 
leading craftsmen past and present are here in the Boston Opera House for you to enjoy – regal surroundings, 
clear and proximate sightlines and near-perfect acoustics. Every seat in the house is a good seat.
The Boston Opera House is currently the official and primary home of the Boston
 Ballet. Dancers perform their classical ballet shows, which are typically performed alongside a full orchestra 
for the perfect culmination of artistic skills.
