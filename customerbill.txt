Our Commitment to You
A safe ride every time
We're continuously monitoring the system to help keep you safe. In addition to Transit Police patrolling the system all day, cameras have been installed in stations and on our vehicles, and T employees are keeping their eyes and ears open for suspicious activity. You can help too. If you see something, say something by calling the Transit Police at 617-222-1212 or by speaking to an MBTA official.

Courteous, clean, accessible, and dependable service
All T employees are trained to ask the question, “How can we help you today?” Simply put, we're here to help you reach your destination in a timely and positive way. If you find our service less than adequate, see a concern, or have an idea for how to improve the system please let us know how we can do better by visiting the customer support section of mbta.com.

Accurate and timely information
We make it our priority to provide you with timely information on service conditions and delays. If we anticipate delays of more than 15 minutes on any service we will post that information to mbta.com, send alerts to T-Alerts subscribers, and post information to station message boards. Want to know where your bus or train is? More than two dozen apps are available to track your bus, subway, or commuter rail train at mbta.com/apps.

Improved communications
Your comments, questions, and ideas help make the T better. The General Manager and T's senior management team are always out on the system. Join them at regular “Join the GM” sessions and customer roundtables. Can't meet us in person? Send us a note through the customer support section of mbta.com, on Twitter at twitter.com/mbtagm, or through mobile tools. We make it our priority to respond within 5 days.

Transparent performance measures
