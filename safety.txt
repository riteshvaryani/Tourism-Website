Safety Information
We work hard everyday to ensure the safety and security of our riders and employees.
Safety Department officials are constantly in the field inspecting stations, busses, subways, commuter rails
and boats to ensure the safest possible environment.

When you ride , you're never alone-all stations and vehicles have direct communication lines to  
Operations Control Center and continue to upgrade stations with modernized public address systems and
closed-circuit television camera systems.

our company's Personnel are thoroughly trained in emergency response and our Safety Program (coordinated with local, state, 
federal law enforcement agencies) includes a rigorous schedule of simulated emergency 
response exercises geared toward preparing us to be equipped with state-of-the-art emergency response techniques.

To learn more about the Safety Program, please contact the Safety Department, at 617-222-5135.
