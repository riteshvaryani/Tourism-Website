			Boston, first incorporated as a town in 1630, and as a city in 1822, is one of America's oldest 
			cities, with a rich economic and social history. What began as a homesteading community eventually 
			evolved into a center for social and political change. Boston has since become the economic and 
			cultural hub of New England.
			As the region's hub, Boston is home to over 617,000 residents, many institutions of higher education,
			some of the world's finest inpatient hospitals, and numerous cultural and professional sports 
			organizations. Boston-based jobs, primarily within the finance, health care, educational, and 
			service areas, numbered nearly 660,000 in 2002. Millions of people visit Boston to take in its 
			historic neighborhoods, attend cultural or sporting events, and conduct business.
